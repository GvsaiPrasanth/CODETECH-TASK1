Title:
Data Preprocessing of Image and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model Training
Objective:
The primary objective of this code is to demonstrate the process of image preprocessing and the creation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification tasks. The code involves several key activities such as reading and preprocessing an image, applying morphological transformations, and building and compiling a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.

Key Activities:
Image Reading and Preprocessing:
Reading the Image: Loading an image from a specified path using OpenCV.
Color Space Conversion: Converting the image from BGR to RGB and grayscale.
Thresholding: Applying Otsu's thresholding to create a binary image.
Morphological Operations: Performing closing and dilation operations to refine the binary image.
Distance Transform and Thresholding: Using distance transform and thresholding to segment the image.
Visualization: Displaying the results of each preprocessing step using Matplotlib.
Building the CNN Model:
Defining the Model Architecture: Creating a Sequential model and adding convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
Compiling the Model: Setting up the model with a loss function (categorical crossentropy), an optimizer (Adam), and metrics (accuracy).
Model Summary: Displaying the summary of the model architecture.
Technologies Used:
Libraries:
OpenCV: For image reading, processing, and transformations.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Matplotlib: For visualizing images and preprocessing steps.
TensorFlow and Keras: For building, compiling, and summarizing the CNN model.
Techniques:

Image Preprocessing: Includes color space conversion, thresholding, and morphological operations to prepare the image for model training.
Distance Transform and Thresholding: Used to segment the image into foreground and background regions.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A deep learning model specifically designed for image classification tasks, including layers for convolution, pooling, dropout, and dense connections.
